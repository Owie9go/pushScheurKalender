# pushScheurKalender
Software to schedule push reminders via ntfy.sh

At the moment the software is very bare bones and purpose built. But I have ambitions to work on this project more.

Thinks I want to include in the future / defenition of done
- Completly customizable reminders (messages, timing etc)
- Having multiple reminders going at the same time (threading)
- Easally deployable via docker
- Web Gui

To use atm have python 3.11 installed and use pip to install requirments.txt
